# Carlos-Challenge-5-Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

The task was to create a functional Work Day Scheduler that not only tracks the day and time but also saves any input for previous, upcoming, and present tasks to a local storage. The program was mainly done through JQuery and Bootstrap. Some coding that I wasa able to get functioning was dispalying the current time and date to the user. But some code I've been having difficulty trying to navigate around such as getting the color classes to align with the current time slot and saving to the local storage. There's still so much to learn more about JQuery and bootstrap and will continue to fix this.
